Good training & placement centre. I would like to thank my faculty & placement coordinator for helping me get an exposure in one of the most reputed IT companies.


Aptech helped me to increase my knowledge. It gave me a clear understanding of IT topics, and also helped me in my academic studies.



It is a good environment to learn the subject in detail. Aptech made me attend many placement interviews, and provided a good training regarding the interview process
